# Sine Wave Prediction using PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple neural network with PyTorch to predict values of a sine wave. It uses a regression approach with a fully connected feed-forward neural network to approximate the `sin(x)` function.

## Features
- Generates synthetic sine wave data using PyTorch.
- Implements a neural network with:
  - One hidden layer with 10 neurons.
  - Tanh activation function for non-linearity.
- Trains the model using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.
- Visualizes the true sine wave and the model's predictions using Matplotlib.
