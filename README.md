# sine_wave_regression
A PyTorch implementation of a simple feed-forward neural network to predict sine wave values using regression. The project generates synthetic data for the sine function, trains a neural network, and visualizes the predictions against the true sine wave. Great for beginners learning PyTorch and neural networks.
